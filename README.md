The application visualizes how champion mastery relates to win rate. In particular, we use a dynamic web-based user interface that shows the user each mastery's effect on win rate, with filters such as champions, role, patch, game type and rank/division. 

The main focus of the project is to construct a visualization that is informative, pleasent to look at, and which can be understood intuitively. 

We will have to parse match data in order to reach statistically significant results. The results will be computed separately and compiled before the app is officially launched. In this way, the necessary amount of data that is sent to the user and the amount of processing done in the web browser is minimal.
